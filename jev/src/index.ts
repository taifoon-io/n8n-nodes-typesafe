/**
 * @taifoon/jev — Jev as a grader any protocol can call.
 *
 *   grade()          evidence → deterministic facts → Jev's atomic questions → composed verdict → receipt
 *   facts()          the deterministic checks a protocol supplies (a failed one is final; Jev is not asked)
 *   record()         the unsigned calls that put the receipt's digests on JevAnswerLog / JevDecisionLog
 *   evaluatorCall()  the unsigned call that ends the job on the protocol whose evaluator seat you hold
 *   verify()         recompute every digest and find the chain events that hold them
 *   RUBRIC_v1        the questions, thresholds and composition (pass your own rubric to grade)
 *   CONTRACTS        where the logs and the evaluator seats are
 *
 * No runtime dependency. No key inside: the free trial, or your own TypeSafe key.
