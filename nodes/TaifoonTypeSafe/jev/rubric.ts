 * the SDK and the n8n node.

 *   · the facts section and the instruction are never cut, and neither are the pack's own "not known" lines;
 *   · only the body of the pack is cut, at a line boundary (a space when a line is longer than half of what fits), and the
 *     cut is stated as one more "not known" line: how long the body is and how much of it the judge reads.
 * A pack that fits passes through byte for byte. Before this rule the compose paths cut the pack at 3,600 characters with a
 * bracketed marker (which could still overflow the lane once the facts were added), judge/grade cut every item to a share
